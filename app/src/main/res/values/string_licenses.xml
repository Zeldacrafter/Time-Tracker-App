      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\n
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n

\n
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n
\n
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n

          stating that You changed the files; and\n
\n
      Â© You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n
          the Derivative Works; and\n
\n
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n
          as modifying the License.\n
\n
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n
      the conditions stated in this License.\n
\n
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n
\n
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n
\n
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
\n
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n
\n
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\n
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\n
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\n
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\n
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\n
\n
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n

      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n
\n
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n
\n
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n
\n
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n
          stating that You changed the files; and\n
\n
      Â© You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n
          the Derivative Works; and\n
\n
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\n
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n
          as modifying the License.\n
\n
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n
      the conditions stated in this License.\n
\n
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n
\n
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n
\n
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\n
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
\n
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n
\n
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n

\n
Preamble\n
\n
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software\n
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.\n
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic\n
control over the development of that Package while still keeping the\n
Package available as open source and free software.\n
\n
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this\n
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.  If the\n
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to\n
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek\n
a different licensing arrangement.\n
\n
Definitions\n
\n
    "Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s)\n
    named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n
\n
    "Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other\n
    material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder\'s\n

    distribute, or modify the Package.\n
\n
    "Package" means the collection of files distributed by the\n

    accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or\n
    organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n
\n
    "Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing\n
    this Package or providing support for this Package to another\n
    party.  It does not mean licensing fees.\n
\n
    "Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been\n
    modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested\n
    by the Copyright Holder.\n
\n
    "Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and\n
    such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright\n
    Holder.\n

(1)  You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use\n
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that\n
you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n
\n
\n
Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n
\n
(2)  You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the\n
Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction,\n
either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate\n
all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.  At\n
your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a\n
Compiled form of the Package.\n
\n
(3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other\n
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.  The resulting\n
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such\n
will be subject to the Original License.\n
\n
\n
Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n
\n
(4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis\n
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the\n
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs\n
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting\n
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that\n
you do at least ONE of the following:\n
\n
    (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder\n
    of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the\n
    Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard\n
    Version.\n
\n
    (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not\n
    prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In\n
    addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different\n
    from the name of the Standard Version.\n
\n
    Â©  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to\n
    make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others\n
    under\n
\n
    (i)  the Original License or\n
\n
    (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,\n
    modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same\n
    licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee\n
    received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified\n
    Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely\n
    available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor\n
    Fees are allowed.\n
\n
\n
Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version\n
or Modified Versions without the Source\n
\n
(5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without\n
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to\n
get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be\n
valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any\n
time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you\n
must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.\n
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty\n
days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then\n
you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.\n
\n
(6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without\n
the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to\n
the Source of the Modified Version.\n
\n
\n
Aggregating or Linking the Package\n
\n
(7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or\n
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting\n
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the\n
Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other\n
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license\n
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions\n
as included in the aggregation.\n
\n
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with\n
other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to\n
build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that\n
include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,\n
provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.\n
\n
\n
Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version\n
\n
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that\n
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause\n
the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not\n
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the\n
terms of this license.\n
\n
\n
General Provisions\n
\n
(10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or\n
Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,\n
modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not\n
use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this\n
license.\n
\n
(11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified\n
Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required\n
to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of\n
this license.\n
\n
(12)  This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,\n
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.\n
\n
(13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide,\n
free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,\n
sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any\n
patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily\n
infringed by the Package. If you institute patent litigation\n
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging\n
that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent\n
infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the\n
date that such litigation is filed.\n
